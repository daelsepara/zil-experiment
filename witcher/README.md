# Witcher ZIL

## Design Goals

With our increasing understanding of ZIL, it is time to create a more sophisticated game. Here, we try to create an interactive fiction game set in the Witcher game universe by CD Projekt Red.

Our goals are to implement these features

- [ ] combat!
- [X] silver and steel swords that can be enhanced by the application of certain oils (11 June 2020)
- [ ] swords with oil should also confer bonuses when combatting specific monsters
- [X] witcher medallion that can detect invisible objects (12 June 2020)
- [X] travelling with or without Roach (12 June 2020)
- [ ] eating/drinking food and/or potions and decoctions
- [ ] monster bounties

(work in progress)
