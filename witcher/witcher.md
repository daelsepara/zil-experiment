# Design Goals

With our increasing understanding of ZIL, it is time to create a more sophisticated game. Here, we try to create and interactive fiction game set in the Witcher games by CD Projekt Red.

Our goals are to implement these features

- combat!
- silver and steel swords that can be enhanced by the application of certain oils. These should also confer bonuses when combatting specific monsters
- witcher medallion that can detect invisible objects
- travelling with or without Roach
- Eating
- monster bounties

(work in progress)
